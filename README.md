Description
---------------
First attempt at an overhaul of the game. The game "Norman the Necromancer" by Dan Prince that is (developed for the JS13k 2022 GameJam - 3rd Place actually :P).

Overhaul (and this Readme) by Sean Scherer.

(My) Issues with the original
-------------------------------

I really love the [original game](https://github.com/danprince/norman-the-necromancer) (else I wouldn't be messing with it here :P).

However, there are some things I disliked, and those were the first I changed here:

* The streak trait meant I was paying a lot of attention to not missing any shots / maxing out the souls I got. I felt I was happier playing before I understood the mechanism (Dan Prince makes a similar point in his GameJam Devlog).
* After playing a while, the game was too easy - both in the early levels, and later with some of the High-powered rituals.
* This meant often all the mobs would be dieing at the edge of the screen (or even slightly outside it, if I was sending skeleton Armies across).
* I hate waiting to "Raise Dead", even with Impatient its long for me :P.

For now, see the commit log for some of the changes I made to address these points. (I may write up a better description and reasoning later on).
