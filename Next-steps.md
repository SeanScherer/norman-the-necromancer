Next Steps / Concepts:
=========================

Implement Raise dead along the lines I intend
-------------------------------------------------
Basic:
* Cost - 1 Mana (and no cooldown/same as for Spell)
* 1-2 or 1-3 Skeletons (per cast)
* random location
* no Souls for those killed by skeleton (implementation of this is secondary for now)


Add a "game start" menu
-----------------------------

* "Start Game" 
* "Credits"
<br>  . . . . . . . . . .
* "Select a Mod"
